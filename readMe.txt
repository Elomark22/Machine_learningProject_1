This project is about predicting survived passenger in the 
titanic incident based in the age, sex, class, and the fare paid.
  I trained machine learning model with difference machine learning algorithms and their percentage accuracies were recorded in comparison.
  We can see that sex is the most important feature of our independent variable.
